        About us
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Steins Restaurant. The restaurant you've never heard of but you definitely should have. It's not just another lame old, plain and unappealing restaurant but
something more pristine, pretigious and high-class without being overtly expensive. It's perfectly affordable for even you minimum wage workers and offers
a restaurant experience like none other. Not only will your physical appetite be sated but also your spiritual and mental ones seeing as how soothing,
calming and serene the atmoshphere here is. We boast of the aura we have managed to create but this is nothing compared to the luxuries of our actual food
service. A restaurant without good food would be missing the most crucial aspect of what makes it a restaurant worth going to. We have managed to go above
and beyond and offer a culinary experience using only the freshest of ingredients and the best of chefs. Our chefs might not be as well renowned and coveted
as Jaime Olive, Gordon Ramsay or Marco Pierre White but we can  assure you with the highest degree of certainty that their skills don't fall short of the 
chefs mentioned above. What are you waiting for?! We have everything you need- and more! You can order anytime from 9AM-10PM on all days of the week exclu-
ding only Saturday. We hope your experience is as great as we think it will be, and we hope to see you again!
